#  n Python, elif stands for "else if". It is used in conditional statements to check multiple conditions.

# ðŸ”¹ Syntax:
# t
# if condition1:
#     # code block if condition1 is true
# elif condition2:
#     # code block if condition2 is true
# elif condition3:
#     # code block if condition3 is true
# else:
#     # code block if none of the above conditions are true
# ðŸ”¸ Example:
# t
num = 15

if num < 10:
    print("Less than 10")
elif num == 10:
    print("Equal to 10")
elif num < 20:
    print("Less than 20")
else:
    print("20 or more")
# Output:

# \
# Less than 20
# âœ… Key Points:
# You can use multiple elif blocks.

# else is optional but should come at the end.

# Python checks conditions from top to bottom and stops when one is true.

# Let me know if you want a fun real-life example too!
